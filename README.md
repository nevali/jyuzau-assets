# Jyuzau asset tree

This folder contains the creative assets for Jyuzau, an open source, open-ended, cel-shaded first-person shooter/space exploration game with RPG elements.

## Legal stuff

Be sure to read the [licensing and copyright notice](https://github.com/nevali/jyuzau-assets/blob/develop/LICENSE.md) for the assets.

## Guiding principles

* The “main” story concerns itself only with the beginning of the journey. In other words, once the main story has finished, the game really begins. Everything in the main story leads the player to a situation where they can freely explore the universe. The expectation is that the main story will actually be much shorter than some of the "side-mission" stories that the player will encounter in the universe.
* Jyuzau is not just open-world, but open-universe. It's intended to be infinitely expandable (within reason).
* The universe itself should be plausible: in particular, cross-overs with other fictional universes are not canon should be confined to “third-party add-ons” (which you should feel free to create, of course—they just won't ever be accepted as patches for this tree).
* At the start of the journey, as far as the player’s concerned, humankind has never made contact with, or observed the existence of, any alien species. Suffice to say, not only do they exist, but we have indeed made contact in the (distant) past. Parts of the universe are populated by expatriate humans, others by species which are completely alien to us, and some are both. Plenty of it, of course, is a desolate uninhabitable mess—although that doesn’t mean there's not necessarily anything interesting there.
