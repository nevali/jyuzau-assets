# Chapter 1: Orientation

## Objectives

* Shut off that damned alarm. Also, find out what’s causing it.
* Determine ship’s systems and inventory status.
* Investigate the object that penetrated the hull.
* Find out which crew records remain.
* Scope out nearby (reachable) systems.

## Outcomes

You learn the following:

* How to use your _aug_ implant
* How to interact with the ship's computer, _Daiigai_, including accessing status, inventory, encyclopaedia, records, and navigation.
* How the rapid transit system works.
* That only six crew records remain. None are senior officers, nor are any of them you.
* That there’s only enough of a key substance needed for SPAN revival to wake up to three other crew members.
* That the object that penetrated the hull is still on-board, and isn’t made of a substance recognisable by the ship's systems.
* How to travel to nearby systems, noting that the Weiyu maintains its course while you explore (meaning you might get left behind)
* What happens when the first wave of the object's effects are triggered (also triggering the end of Chapter 1)
