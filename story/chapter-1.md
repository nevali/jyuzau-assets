# Chapter 1

In 2345, the Lingshan Mining Corporation[1] initiated its most significant long-term investment to date: the launch of the _Weiyu_, an interstellar behemoth carrying everything required to rare mine minerals not found in our solar system, refine them, and send them back to Earth.

Despite technological developments which enabled near-instant global travel (precipitating a number of bloody invasions and significant alterations to the power balance on Earth over the course of the 22nd and 23rd centuries) and the great strides in propulsion systems, pan-galatic travel still takes centuries, if not millennia, to complete. It's made possible only through the use of _SPAN caskets_, which place its occupants into a state of near-suspended animation, slowing cellular activity to a tiny fraction of its normal rate.

As with all Lingshan projects, all of the crew of the Weiyu were selected through the province’s labour lottery. They, and their families, were placed into SPAN caskets where with few exceptions they would remain for the duration of the journey.

You are one of those exceptions: you were granted the dubious honour of being the first _cingit_[2], and are being revived from SPAN a third of the way into the journey, XXX miles (YYY light-years) from Earth. You, and two others who will be woken after you've acclimatised, are responsible for checking over the Weiyu’s systems to ensure that they are in proper working order. Another trio of cingits will be awoken two-thirds of the way through your journey to do the same again.

At least, that was how the mission was planned by your corporate masters.

Unfortunately, as you were being revived, an object breached the Weiyu's hill and disrupted several on-board systems. Although the ship's computer's core functions are intact and it was able to seal the breach, the SPAN revival system was damaged, and most of the crew records—including yours—were destroyed.

As so you find yourself in deep space, in sole control of a ship the size of a small town accelerating at some pace away from your home, with no idea who you are or what you're supposed to be here for. To make matters worse, you have a splitting headache, and _really_ need to figure out how to turn off that damned alarm.
