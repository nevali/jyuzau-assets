# Prologue

In 2345, the Lingshan Mining Corporation initiated its most significant long-term investment to date: the launch of the _Weiyu_, an interstellar behemoth carrying everything required to mine rare minerals not found in our solar system, refine them, and send them back to Earth.

Headquartered in the desolate Earth city of _New Qinzhou_, the Lingshan Mining Corporation has remained amongst the five most powerful corporations in the solar system for the best part of two centuries. Its resources and close links with the establishment saw it play a pivotal role in the _Great Zhonghua Minzu Wars_, a brutal campaign beginning in the mid-22nd century for terrestrial (and later, system-wide) dominance triggered by technological developments which enabled near-instant global travel.

The capture of _Novosibirsk_—and its formal re-institution as New Qinzhou in 2279—marked the end of the Wars, and the beginning of a long period of uneasy peace between the system’s three principal super-states of _Zhonghua Minzu_, _Estados Unidos Mexcanos_ and _Bhārat Gaṇarājya_.

While remaining, for the moment, the formal seat of power for all three nations, the planet Earth has become a shell of its former self. For centuries, Military needs consistently overrode persistent environmental concerns, and the planet has been almost completely stripped of its remaining natural assets.

One of the few areas of begrudged co-operation between the super-powers has been in using high volumes of otherwise worthless industrial by-products in a desperate attempt to fill in the huge schisms in the planet’s structure. Naturally, this isn’t motivated by any particular emotional attachment to Earth, but out of concern for the effect upon the other bodies in the solar system that a planetary collapse might have. Beneath the political front of co-operation, the ruling administrations all privately recognise that Earth's days are numbered, and that our solar system will once again become a very unpredictable place, with each wary of what the others might do to capitalise upon the upheaval.

Lingshan’s own history is one of repeated adaptation to circumstance. Initially the operator of a modest coal mine in southern China, Lingshan grew and diversified as technologies—and demand for materials—shifted over time. Its uncompromising approach to expansion, a combination of close government relationships and aggressive acquisitions, took it from coal to iron ore to rare minerals, and eventually, to capitalising upon the demand for materials only found far beyond the reaches of our solar system. 

Despite the availability of rapid transit across the system and great strides in propulsion systems, pan-galatic travel still takes centuries, if not millennia, to complete. It's made possible only through the use of _SPAN caskets_, which place its occupants into a state of near-suspended animation, slowing cellular activity within the body to a tiny fraction of its normal rate.

As with all major Lingshan projects, the crew of the Weiyu were selected by the province’s labour lottery. They, and their families, were placed into the thousands of SPAN caskets where—with few exceptions—they would remain for the duration of the long journey into deep space.

You are one of those exceptions: granted the dubious honour of being the first _cingit_ (from the Cantonese _“清潔工”_, meaning “janitor”), you are being revived from SPAN a third of the way into the journey, 15.6 parsecs (approximately 51 light-years) from Earth.

You, and two others who will be woken after you've been re-acclimatised, will be responsible for checking over the Weiyu’s systems to ensure that they are in proper working order. Another trio of cingits will be woken two-thirds of the way through the journey to do the same again.

At least, that was how the mission was planned by your corporate masters.

Unfortunately, as you were being revived—shortly after you regained consciousness, but before your memories were properly restored—an object breached the Weiyu’s hull and disrupted several on-board systems. Although the ship’s computer’s core functions are intact and emergency repair systems were able to seal the breach, the SPAN revival system was damaged, and most of the crew records—including your own—were destroyed.

And so you find yourself in deep space, in sole control of a ship the size of a small town, accelerating at some pace away from your home planet, with no idea who you are or what you're supposed to be here for.

To make matters worse, you have a splitting headache and _really_ need to figure out how to turn off that damned alarm.
